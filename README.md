## Hi There! üëã

<img src = "src/usc.gif" width = 100%>

‚≠ê This is **Boyang Xiao `(/Àà Éa ä/)`**, you can also call me **Sean**. I am now a graduate student focused on Electrical & Computer Engineering in [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/). This is my Github homepage to accomadate my **Course projects/ Individual projects/ Study notes**.

üè´ Before USC, I got my Bachelor degree of Engineering from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in Tianjin, China. I was then majored in Optic-elctrical Information Engineering. After graduating from TJU, I had been working an Software Devlopment Engineer in [Wuhan HGLaser Engineering Co.,Ltd](https://www.hgtech-laser.com/about-us). It was actually a fun job. My co-workers and I collaborated to build a computer-aided manufacturing(CAM) software using C++ on Windows

üßë‚Äçüíª Right now, I am working with [DeepUSC Research Group](https://deep.usc.edu) in USC as a Software Engineer, where I am a part of the projects for some real cool web applications for Machine Learning research! Oops... I can't tell more about it! But you can look forward to our products very soon!

üåê My interests mainly focus on full-stack web developments. I have actually developed some quite interesting apps that you can find links below. The main techniques I use are React.js, Express.js, Vite, Webpack and MongoDB. RESTful APIs are my major styles but I also switch to GraphQL if I am in a right moodüòÑ Please check out my repos and make your contributions if you find them interesting too!!

üëã Anyway, it's a great pleasure that you clicked in my profiles. I'm Sean and nice to meet you!
