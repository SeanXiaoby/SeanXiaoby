## Hi There! 👋

⭐ This is **Boyang Xiao (/ˈʃaʊ/)**, you can also call me **Sean**. I am now a graduate student focused on Electrical Engineering & Computer Science in [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/). This is my Github homepage to accomadate my **Course projects/ Individual projects/ Study notes**.

🏫 Before USC, I got my Bachelor degree of Engineering from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in Tianjin, China. I was then majored in Optic-elctrical Information Engineering.

🧑‍💻 I had been working as an Software Devlopment Engineer in [Wuhan HGLaser Engineering Co.,Ltd](https://www.hgtech-laser.com/about-us). It was actually a fun job. My co-workers and I collaborated to build a computer-aided manufacturing(CAM) software using C++ on Windows7/Windows10, which can be used to read CAD drawing files, to modify the drawing contents and to control the LASER and the galvanometer to work according to the drawing files.

**Okay okay!! I know you are not interested in my Bio, at least not that much.** Then let me show you something more fun!!🤭
